
## Introduction:
# We will explore the relationship between the GDP ranking of a country to each country's average income. 
# In order to do this, we will be merging a GDP Ranking Table dataset with an Education Statistics data set. In cleaning and merging these two data sets, we will be able to answer the following questions:
# 1) Once merged, how many of the Country IDs match?
# 2) After sorting the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank (so United States is last), What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame?
# 3) What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" groups?
# 4) How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with the highest GDP?

## We will also practice creating plots and tables:
# 5) Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.
# 6) Cut the GDP rankings into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group.

### Part 1: Download the files for this case study.

# This data is from http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table and 
# http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats
# The data in the GDP ranking data set include the variables "Country"", "ranking", "Economy", and "millions of US dollars".

# The data in the Education Statistics data set include multiple variables about the economic status of the different countries around the world. The data spans from 1976 to 2014.

## Packages needed for Case Study:

library(downloader)
library(dplyr)
library(doBy)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

## Download Data from online:

download("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv", destfile="GDPRanking.csv")
download("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv", destfile="EducationStatistics.csv")

cat("Data downloaded into current working directory")

### Part 2: Read the data into R and examine it.


GDP.Raw <- read.csv("GDPRanking.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=FALSE, skip = 5) 
EducStat.Raw <- read.csv("EducationStatistics.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE) 
cat("Data read into R")
 

## Examine data
# Use 'str' function to get a feel for the two data sets:

str(GDP.Raw)# Notice the lack of variable names and excessive NA's

str(EducStat.Raw)


# Look at the last 10 observations:

tail(GDP.Raw, 10) #Notice all the NA's that fill the data set. We will eliminate these.
tail(EducStat.Raw, 10)


dim(GDP.Raw) # We can see that the two data sets are different dimensions.
dim(EducStat.Raw)


### Part 3: Time to Clean the Data.

# Give the GDP dataset variables descriptive names

colnames(GDP.Raw) <- c("CountryCode","Ranking", " " ,"Long.Name", "GDP" )


# Delete the empty columns with NA's in the GDP.Raw data set

myvars <- c("CountryCode","Ranking", "Long.Name", "GDP")
GDP.subset <- GDP.Raw[myvars]


## Changed the variable "Ranking" to numeric from character
# We will eliminate the 136 NA's after the merge.

GDP.subset$Ranking <- as.numeric(GDP.subset$Ranking) # Changed "Ranking" to numeric from character
count(GDP.subset[!complete.cases(GDP.subset$Ranking),]) #Counts the missing data in the "Ranking" Variable. 136 missing data.
summary(GDP.subset$Ranking) # Also shows 136 NA's


### Part 4 : Merge Data and clean some more

CleanData1 <- merge(GDP.subset,EducStat.Raw, by = "CountryCode", all=FALSE) #Merges the data


# Change GDP variable from character to numeric in order to calculate averages.

CleanData1$GDP <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",CleanData1$GDP)) # Changed "GDP" to numeric from character and eliminate the Commas

str(CleanData1) # Notice that "Ranking" and "GDP" are now numeric



CleanData2 <- CleanData1[order(-CleanData1$Ranking),] # Ordered the data frame by ascending rank. United States is last now.



## Created tidy data set by "Ranking"

FinalCleanData <- CleanData2[!is.na(CleanData2$Ranking),] # Made new data set that doesn't have the na's in the Ranking column, is now Tidy Data.

### Question 1) We can see that 189 Country ID's matched in the merge.

dim(FinalCleanData)

### Question 2) The 13th country in ascending order is St. Kitts and Nevis

head(FinalCleanData$Long.Name.x, 13)


# Find the average GDP Ranking by Income group. 
### Question 3) The average GDP ranking by Income.Group

summaryBy(Ranking~Income.Group,data=FinalCleanData, FUN=mean) 


# Plot the GDP for all countries and color by Income Group.
### Skipping to Question 5) Plotted GDP for all 189 countries and colored them by their income group.

ggplot(data = FinalCleanData, 
      aes(x = Long.Name.x, 
           y = GDP, 
           color = Income.Group)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_discrete(name = "Country") +          #Label x-axis
      scale_y_discrete(name = "GDP in US Dollars")  #Label y-axis

      
# Cut GDP Ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. 
### Question 6.1) Separate GDP Ranking into 5 quantile groups.

FinalCleanData$GDP.Quantiles <- with(FinalCleanData, factor(
  findInterval( Ranking, c(-Inf,
                       quantile(Ranking, probs=c(0.2, .4, .6, .8)), Inf)), 
  labels=c("Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4", "Q5")))


### Question 6.2) Make a table of the 5 GDP quantile groups versus Income group.
#Make a Table versus Income.Group

GDP.Table <- table(FinalCleanData$Income.Group, FinalCleanData$GDP.Quantiles)
GDP.Table


# How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with the highest GDP?
### Back to question 4) There are 5 countries that are considered lower middle income, but are among the 38 nations with the highest GDP.

Lower.Middle.Income <- sum(FinalCleanData$Income.Group == "Lower middle income" & FinalCleanData$Ranking <= 38)
Lower.Middle.Income


### Conclusion:
# We have taken (2) data sets,(GDP.csv and EDSTATS_Country.csv), cleaned them and merged them. We cleaned the data sets by the GDP Ranking variable. We removed columns and rows that contained NA's, we reordered the data in ascending order by GDP Rank, and we gave the variables proper names. 
### We discovered a relationship between GDP Ranking and Income Group by plotting them and making a table. The higher the average country income, the higher the average GDP Rank.
